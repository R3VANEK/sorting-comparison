# Sorting Comparison

This project aims to measure and compare the performance of various sorting algorithms implemented in C++. The sorting algorithms included in this project are:

- Shell sort
- Quicksort
- Insertion sort
- Heap sort

## Introduction

Sorting algorithms are essential in computer science and have various implementations, each with its own advantages and disadvantages. This project provides implementations of four popular sorting algorithms and compares their performance in different scenarios based on factors such as time complexity, array conditions and data types

## Usage

To use this project, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Compile the source code using a C++ compiler.
3. Run the executable file with appropriate parameters.

Program has minimalistic console menu to navigate through and provides a way to test each sorting algorythm. To measure and test sortings, please make use of `measure_sorting` method of appriopriate classes

## File
It's possible to enter your own array data to test sorting. In the interactive menu you will be prompted about a text file to fetch data from. Format of it should be like this:

- first line has one line interpreted as count of numbers
- each line afterwards has one number

## Results
As part of this project I prepared an rather extensive analysis of given algorythms. You can see it right [here](./AIZO.pdf) (polish only)
